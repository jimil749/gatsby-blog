## What Did I do last week?

It's been a long 3 weeks! I continued working on the runtime plugin module for the last month or so. I am regularly reviewing, updating
and making my PR better. After supporting the compiled binary loading, the next feature that I implemented was the compiling of the plugin 
and then loading it on the reva core. In order to facilitate this, I used the `go exec` utility to compile the provided code and then 
load the code! 

PS: The results of the first evaluation period were out on 16th July and I'm glad that I could pass it and hope to continue the good work.

## What will I do next week?

The plan for next week is to download and load plugins hosted as version controlled repository. The user can provide configuration
such as:

```
[grpc.services.userprovider]
driver = "github.com/jimil749/reva-plugin
```

The reva package should be able to download the code, compile it and then load it for the usage.

## Any hiccups?

Not really. Just a few bugs here and there, but nothing major!
