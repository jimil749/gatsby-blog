## What Did I do last week?

The last week was more about discussions, design, presentations and evaluation rather than coding. After completing the benchmarking 
of various golang plugin systems, it was time to finalize a plugin system. Before finalizing the plugin system, I had a task to 
prepare a presentation indicating all the trade-offs of the various plugin systems. Along with that, I also had to give in my take
for the plugin system that would fit our use case. After a healthy discussions with the mentors, a decision was made to move forward 
with the hashicorp go-plugin system. Hashicorp go-plugin serves plugin over rpc/gRPC. What protocol to use (rpc or grpc) is yet to be decided.

In order to facilitate the discussions, I've opened up a [github issue](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/issues/1814) in the reva 
repository. This is further help in paving way for building the plugin architecture.

## What will I do next week?

The plan for next week is to continue the discussions and design of the runtime-plugins. 

## Any hiccups?

There weren't any issues or roadblocks last week. I hope every week goes by as smoothly as this one! :)
