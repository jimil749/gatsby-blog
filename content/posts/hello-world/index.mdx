Hey there, I'm Jimil Desai! I am a senior at School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Ahmedabad University. This summer, I'll
be contributing to the [Reva](https://github.com/cs3org/reva) project during GSoC'21. I'll be essentially working on adding 
runtime plugins to the Reva Codebase. At the end of the project, plugins could be added to Reva at runtime by pointing to a source
of Go module.

## What did I do this week?

I spent most of the time of Community Bonding Period getting familiar with the Reva project and the CERNBOX community. This 
invovled setting up of development environment locally and reading relevent documentation. I also set up the GitHub project to keep track of
my project with relevent milestones. I did a deep dive into the Reva codebase learning more about the exisiting plugins and planning about how to move them out as 
external plugins that can be loaded at runtime. I spent the second half of the community bonding period doing some basic 
research on various open source go plugin systems. This was done to get a gist of how each plugin system works and how 
plausible each system is. 

Following plugin systems were considered:

1. Hashicorp go-plugin
2. Traefik Yaegi Go-interpreter
3. Pie Plugin
4. Native Go Plugin package
5. Goloader

## What is coming up next week?

I would be working on Benchmarking the Hashicorp, Pie and native Go plugin system.

## Any issues faced during this Period?

No! This week went by smoothly
