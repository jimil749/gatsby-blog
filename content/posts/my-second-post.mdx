## What Did I do last week?

The coding phase of GSoC'21 finally began last week. My aim for last week was to complete benchmarking atleast 3 golang plugin
systems, which I was able to accomplish. Last week I finished benchmarking the following golang plugin systems:

1. Hashicorp go-plugin over RPC and gRPC
2. Pie Plugin
3. Native go plugin

For the purpose of benchmarking, I used the existing JSON plugin from the Reva codebase. As far as the performance is concerned,
I've ranked the above mentioned plugins in the order of performance (Fastest to slowest):

1. Native Go plugin
2. Pie Plugin
3. Hashicorp go-plugin RPC
4. Hashicorp go-plugin gRPC


Overall, I'd say it was fun working on benchmarking the plugins and it went on smoothly. There weren't any roadblocks/bugs as such.

## What will I do next week?

The plan for next week is to continue go plugin system benchmarking. Next week, I plan to benchmark following go plugin systems:

1. Goloader
2. Traefik Yaegi

## Any hiccups?

Other than minor bugs, there weren't any major roadblocks. It went by smoothly! :)
